## My process

### Built with

-   HTML5
-   CSS
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me practice my flexbox skills for arranging items in a layout. I used different flexbox properties to aligning the items according to the needs specified in the project.

Following are some snippets I used to create the design:

```css
.wrapper {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100vh;
}

.card {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;

	width: 275px;
	height: 430px;
	padding: 15px;

	border-radius: 20px;
	background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

	box-shadow: 0 0 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```
